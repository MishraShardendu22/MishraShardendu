  "description": "Tinder-LLD is a comprehensive C++ implementation of a dating application that demonstrates several design patterns. It uses the Observer Pattern for notifications, Strategy Pattern for different matching algorithms (Basic, Interests-based, Location-based), Factory Pattern for matcher creation, and Singleton Pattern for services. The system supports user profiles, location-based matching, chat functionality, swipe mechanics, and follows SOLID principles for extensible dating platform design.",
