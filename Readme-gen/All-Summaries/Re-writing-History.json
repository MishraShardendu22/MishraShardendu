  "description": "A Go script that retroactively edits Git commit metadata (author name, email, date) for cloned GitHub repositories. Uses AI integration via OpenRouter API to generate realistic commit dates and rewrites repository history using git filter-branch. Features automated cloning, metadata extraction, AI-powered date generation, and force-push capabilities.",
